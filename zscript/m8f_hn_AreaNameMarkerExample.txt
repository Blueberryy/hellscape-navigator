// This is an example of Area Name Marker
// To make Hellscape Navigator display the custom area name:
//
// 1. Copy this class to your wad/pk3 ZScript code;
// 2. Give the class a unique name, e.g. my_own_hn_AreaNameMarker_something
//    The name can by anything, but it must contain substring "hn_AreaNameMarker"
//    to be recognized by Hellscape Navigator.
// 3. Area name is stored in "Tag" property, so put it there.
// 4. Area radius is stored in "Health" property, so put it there.
// 5. Put an object of this class on the map.
//
// Notes:
// - You can create as many AreaMarker classes as you want, each of them can
//   carry its own area name.
// - AreaNameMarker detection is dynamic, so if actor moves on the map, area name
//   moves with it.
